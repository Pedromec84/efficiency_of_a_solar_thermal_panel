# efficiency_of_a_solar_thermal_panel
In this work it's calculated the efficiency_of_a_solar_thermal_panel using the Diffie and Beckman methodology. 
In this work a code was implemented, in Python language, to calculate the thermal efficiency of a flat solar collector following the theory developed by DUFFIE and BECKMAN (1991), also used by KALOGIROU (2004) and by SIQUEIRA (2009). The analysis is calculated from some input data provided by the user, where some equations are calculated and thus estimated the efficiency of the collector and the informed collector information.
